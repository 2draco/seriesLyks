Inside were two mini-cassette audio tapes dated December 30, 1999 and labeled &\"The Last Testament of George Harrison&\". A voice eerily similar to Harrison's tells a shocking story: Paul McCartney was killed in a car crash in November of 1966 and replaced with a double! British intelligence, MI5, had forced the Beatles to cover up McCartney's death to prevent mass suicides of Beatle fans. However, the remaining Beatles tried to signal fans with clues on album covers and in songs. Until now, the &\"Paul is Dead&\" mystery that exploded worldwide in 1969 was considered a hoax. However, in this film, the mysterious voice on the tapes reveals a secret Beatles history, chronicling McCartney's fatal accident, the cover up, dozens of unknown clues, and a dangerous cat and mouse game with &\"Maxwell,&\" the Beatles' MI5 handler, as John Lennon became increasingly reckless with the secret. The voice also claims that Lennon was assassinated in 1980 after he threatened to finally expose &\"Paul McCartney&\" as an imposter! Highway 61 Entertainment has investigated this stunning new account of the conspiracy to hide McCartney's tragic death and produced this unauthorized documentary that includes newly unearthed evidence.
