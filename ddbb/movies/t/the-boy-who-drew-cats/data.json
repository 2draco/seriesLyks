Joji wanders the barren Japanese landscape until he meets an old woman who points him toward an ancient temple. However, the old woman fails to mention that the temple had been deserted because a goblin, known in Japan as the Nezumi Mamono (who is basically a goblin in the form of a giant rat), had driven the priests away, and the warriors who went against it were never seen again.
