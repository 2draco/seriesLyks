Margo spends her nights traversing the massive mausoleum corridors, chatting with her &\"quiet friends&\" as she goes about mopping the ancient marble floors. Margo's singular earthbound companion is George, the night watchmen, a man so ridden with grief over the loss of his daughter that he seems even deader to the world than the corpses in the morgue. The seclusion of Margo's night-time haven is shattered when Peter and Nan Townsend appear mysteriously out of the darkness with nothing more than an empty gas can and a frightened young girl, Jill.
