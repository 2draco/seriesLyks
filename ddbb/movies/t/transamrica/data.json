But before Margaret, her therapist, will allow her to go through with the surgery scheduled in a week's time, Bree has to deal with an unresolved issue from her past. Bree got a telephone call from a seventeen year old man named Toby Wilkins, who was looking for Stanley, his biological father. Toby is in a New York jail, he who supports himself by petty crime and hustling. Stanley/Bree knew nothing about Toby before the telephone call. Toby apparently is all alone in the world, with his mother having committed suicide and being estranged from his stepfather in Tennessee.
