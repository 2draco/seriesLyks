RuPaul isStarrbooty, a top (well, actually a bottom as you'll soon discover) secret ops agent who is plunged into chaos when her niece is kidnapped by long-time nemesis and fellow indulger of flawless skin and skin-tight couture, Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne).

Starrbooty is forced to go \"undercover ho\" to rescue her niece... and her own true identity. Directed by hunky photographer and actor Mike Ruiz (that's him on the cover of Latin Boys Go to Hell), the hell-raising Starrbooty is stuffed and tucked with some of the most outrageously twisted set pieces you'll see this year. Highlights include a priest with a penchant for yanking his \"rosary\" while inhaling freshly expelled air biscuits, Starrbooty taking it up the wazoo from her boss, Max (a very naked Gus Mattox), explicit full-on frontal pleasures from Michael Lucas and Owen Hawk and a demented Lady Bunny unleashing her \"inner beauty\" in a scene certain to cause horrified howls of laughter. Truth be told, the too-closely shot hand held camerawork during the fight scenes requires the viewer to take a huge hit of Dramamine\u00ae to keep up with it, some of the jokes are groan-inducing, and a lil' bit of judicious editing could have kept the flick moving at a better clip. But make no mistake - Starrbooty is RuPaul's show all the way, and the forever Supermodel of the World delivers on all counts. Filled with references to iconic films; mad-fierce outfits, wigs and makeup; scatological humor (literally!); a wicked soundtrack; and plenty of exposed he-man flesh rods, Starrbooty is a fried, dyed and laid to the side-splitting kick-ass good time.
