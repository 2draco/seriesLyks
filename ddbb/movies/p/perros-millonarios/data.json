The dogs try and eat Emmo, but in order to save his life, the parrot promises them a new home with his owner, the wealthy Miss Lilly. The two dogs feel right at home at their new mansion, along with Miss Lilly's other pets (all strays): the beautiful Bella, the frisky Velvet, and the guard dog Sherman. Unfortuantely, it doesn't take long for Miss Lilly to &\"kick the bucket&\", and the dogs' future is in jeapordy, especially since Miss Lilly's scheaming niece & nephew, Ronnie & Hannie (quite possibly the creepiest cartoons ever created) have had their eyes on the estate for quite some time.
