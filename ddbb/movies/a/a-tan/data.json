Known as the best satire about communism, 'The Witness' has become a cult classic, which was also well received by critics and general audiences alike when it was finally released outside of Hungary. Its candid and realistic portrayal of the incompetent communist regime has earned great acclaim for both the director and the film itself when it was shown at Cannes Film Festival in 1981.

Instead of doing hard time for his &\"heinous&\" crime, Pelik\u00e1n is elevated into an important position, generally reserved for the communist elite.
