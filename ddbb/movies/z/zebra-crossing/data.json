Blending the surreal, and very real, we take an intense journey in search of friendship, belief and religion. With a lacklustre father and estranged mother, Justin's only source of perennial control comes from an unlikely source, his bed-ridden sister Suzanne. But Justin needs is a real mentor, a father figure, someone who can provide guidance before it's all too late. In steps Marcus, unlike anyone Justin has ever known before, calm, soft, assured - but does he want something from Justin? Meanwhile, Tommy's abandonment issues haunt him once again, and his class-A drug addiction has sent him into full destruction mode. Also, the pressure from a rival gang has reached exploding point - as there is certainly no space for two crews in this neighbourhood. Justin must find the answer to it all, and quick.
