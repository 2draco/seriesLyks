However, the king has seven children and the new queen soon becomes jealous as he often leaves to visit them at their secret home in the woods.

Before leaving, they tell Elisa of the one way she alone could break the spell. She would have to collect nettle and spin it into thread with which to make six shirts, one for each of her brothers, for six years.
