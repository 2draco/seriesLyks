He is a San Francisco based electronic surveillance expert who owns and operates his own small surveillance business.

He is an intensely private and solitary man, both in his personal and professional life, which irks especially Stan, his business associate who often feels shut out of what is happening with their work.

His and Stan's latest job, a difficult one, is to record the private discussion of a young male/female couple meeting in crowded and noisy Union Square. The arrangement with his client, known only to him as &\"the director&\", is to provide the audio recording of the discussion and photographs of the couple directly and only to him in return for payment. Based on circumstances with the director's assistant, Martin Stett, and what Harry ultimately hears on the recording, Harry believes that the lives of that young couple are in jeopardy. Harry used to be detached from what he recorded, but is now concerned ever since the deaths of three people was the direct result of a previous audio recording he made for another job. Harry not only has to decide if he will turn the recording over to the director, but also if he will try and save the couple's lives using information from the recording.
