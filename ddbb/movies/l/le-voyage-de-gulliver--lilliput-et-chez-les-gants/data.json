How Gulliver set out on a journey and was shipwrecked on an island, where he found strange people, so small that a hundred of them full size could safely repose in the hollow of his hand. How he fell asleep, was discovered by the inhabitants of the island and securely bound with thousands of feet of cord and made to promise to do everything he was told under pain of instant death. He became a favorite with the people, who finally trusted him, but his roving nature would not permit him to settle there permanently. A most interesting part of this film is in which the King and Queen arrive to look on the giant from a strange land, and as the Queen arrives and sits down, Gulliver immediately lifts her upon the table, upon which he has prepared his food, and the Queen and he hold intercourse, after which he again places her and the receptacle in which she is carried, to the ground. Immediately after a fire breaks out, and while the people try to attack their fire apparatus, Gulliver seizes a seltzer bottle and extinguishes the blaze with its contents. He leaves the island at last, and after wandering about for some months he is again shipwrecked, but this time is thrown among the giants, who look upon him, a natural-sized man, as a novelty. They pick him up like a top, and one amuses himself by blowing a cloud of smoke in Gulliver&#x27;s face, the while smoking a huge clay pipe. The Princess of the giants, learning of the new arrival, dismisses her followers and interviews the little man, who being too far away, climbs a ladder in order to reach the Princess, but she admonishes him for his presumption and in his confusion he falls to the ground.
