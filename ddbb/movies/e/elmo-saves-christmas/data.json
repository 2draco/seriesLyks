Big Bird is saddened that Mr. Snuffleupagus is going to Cincinnati to visit his grandmother for Christmas, but he assures him he'll be back the day after. Elmo does manage this year, but is surprised when Santa gets stuck in the chimney. Elmo pulls him out, and he is frustrated at Lightning, a fast-footed young reindeer who hopes to pull Santa's sleigh one day, hiding in his bag of toys, which made it so big it couldn't fit through the chimney. After scolding him, Santa explains to Elmo that when he pulled him out of the chimney, he saved Christmas and offers him a magic snow globe which gives him three wishes (he picked it over a pink bear). After wishing for a glass of water,he wishes it would be Christmas every day. Suddenly, all the businesses are permanently closed for Christmas, gifts and trees (being sold by Grover) are selling like hotcakes, and the elves are angry at having their vacation spoiled. Santa and Lightning hurry to Sesame Street, and Lightning uses his speed to take Elmo into the future so Santa can prove Christmas every day isn't all it's cracked up to be. The elves mess up from being too tired, the carolers lose their voices, the Easter Bunny becomes the Christmas Bunny, the Count gets tired of counting Christmases, and Big Bird can't see Snuffy any more because he's in Cincinnati.
