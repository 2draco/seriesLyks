From the beginning he experiences large and small racist difficulties. In his teens he and Sarah fall in love. Her father is an extreme racist. Schlomo tries to gain &\"real Jewishness&\" by winning a competition in Bible interpretation. No change of Sarah's father's attitude. Disappointed he goes to the police and reports himself as not being a Jew. But the police officer just gives him a scolding. &\"The newspapers are full of that stuff, the Falashas are no Jews.

Sarah's first line when she returns: &\"Unbelievable what three mothers would do for you.&\" But she makes a condition for returning: Schlomo must meet his real mother again.
