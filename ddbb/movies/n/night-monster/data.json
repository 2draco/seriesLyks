Three medical doctors have been invited out to the mansion as well, Dr. Timmons, Dr. Phipps and the sleazy Dr. King (Lionel Atwill). One by one the doctors are mysteriously murdered. Dick Baldwin must figure out who is doing the killings, and he must do so before whoever it is can kill his new love interest, Dr. Lynne Harper.

Is it sinister Rolf, the butler, or Laurie, the sex crazed and sociopathic chauffeur, or Agor Singh, the Hindu Yogi with his strange ways? And of course, Lynne might be wrong, Margaret may be very insane, and she might be the culprit.
