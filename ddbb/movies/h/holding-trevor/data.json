At the hospital for his boyfriend's latest overdose, Trevor finds a potential new beginning in Ephram, a medical intern with ambition, a warm demeanor and strikingly good looks.

Though pulled in multiple directions, Trevor remains committed to bettering his life. But first he must realize that some people are too precious to abandon.
