The men must decide whether to be law-abiding citizens and report the drugs or take the drugs and sell them for millions of dollars. Various opportunities present themselves to the hunters for them to leave the drugs behind and make off with their lives. This creates conflicts between the two protagonists, Brandon and Jose. Jose is a Cuban American whose greed and selfishness is driving the hunter's odyssey. Brandon is an Anglo American who has no interest in risking his life for the drugs, but is swept with a lie that puts him in the forefront to kill or be killed. However, he is watched over by a supernatural guardian who protects him in his quest to survive. The third hunter, Peter, has little will of his own. He usually agrees with Jose who is the more insistent of the two. The lure of easy money entices the hunters into an action packed adventure as drug dealers - led by Paco, a cold and ruthless Colombian drug lord - chase them in their quest for their precious cargo. Their decision to take the drugs leads them on spine tingling confrontations with the drug dealers who both outnumber and out gun them.   Written by  Juan C.
