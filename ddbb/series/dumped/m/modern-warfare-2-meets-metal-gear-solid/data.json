But who is the real mastermind controlling Makarov and Liquid?\r\n\r\n* * * * * *\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n1) Where did you get the guns?\r\nThey are airsoft guns from Ehobbyasia.com. The main guns in Parts 1 and 2 are the G&P Sentry, WE SCAR GBB, and the A&K Masada. \r\n\r\n2) What camera equipment do you use?\r\nWe are currently using the Canon 7d. I really love it.\r\nWe also use the Backbird Stabilizer, the only small stabilizer I've been impressed with. For future videos, Rick is getting a Kessler Crane and dolly. It's going to be insane. For more info on our gear check out: http://www.beatdownboogie.com/2010/12/17/whats-new-in-modern-war-gear-solid-p...\r\n\r\n3) Where did you get the costumes?\r\nThere is a detailed breakdown on our blog:\r\nhttp://www.beatdownboogie.com/2010/12/17/modern-war-gear-solid-costume-guide/\r\nMost of the tactical/combat gear is also from Ehobbyasia.\r\n\r\n4) How much did Parts 1 and 2 cost?\r\nIf you count all the gear we already had like prop guns and camera equipment it would be pretty expensive. But the money we spent specifically for Parts 1 and 2 was three to five hundred bucks, mostly on pizza delivery.\r\n\r\n5) What is the end credits music?\r\nAll the music in Parts 1 and 2 is royalty free stock music, except for a cover of the Old Snake Theme performed by Rick Burnett. The end credits music is Anthem for War, composed by Cassidy Bisher.\r\n\r\n* * * * * *\r\nThanks for all the great comments!\r\nNews on future episodes can be found on our blog.\r\n\r\nBeat Down Boogie Website:\r\nhttp://beatdownboogie.com/\r\n\r\nBeat Down Boogie on Facebook:\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/beatdownboogie\r\n\r\nBeat Down Boogie on Twitter:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/beatdownboogie"], "languages": [], "compose": [], "title": "Modern Warfare 2 meets Metal Gear Solid", "plot_es": ["We're on facebook now! http://www.facebook.com/beatdownboogie\r\n\r\nMODERN WAR GEAR SOLID DVDS AVAILABLE AT: http://www.beatdownboogie.com/bdbstore/\r\n\r\nMODERN WAR GEAR SOLID - ACT 1\r\n\r\nWhen Makarov and Liquid Ocelot team up, it's up to Snake and Ghost to stop them.
