Can he last 60 days on an uninhabited Fijian island with absolutely nothing? No survival tools, no rations, no clothes, no film crew... It&#x27;s a daunting challenge and nobody&#x27;s ever done it before. In fierce tropical heat, he has only hours to find water before dehydration ends his attempt before it&#x27;s begun.
