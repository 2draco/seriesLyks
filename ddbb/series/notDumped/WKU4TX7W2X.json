When the door is opened they are startled by a sight that makes their blood run cold. The figure standing there is covered in scars and has a strange, insane glint in his eye! In the days that follow the grizzled old sailor, Bill Bones, spends hours on end staring out to sea; until the day a crazed blind man at the head of a murderous gang of pirates tracks down Bill Bones - and murders him! All for a scrap of paper, Jim discovers to his amazement; But this scrap of paper is a map marking the location of fabulous buried treasure, gold, silver and jewels saved over the years by the ruthless and highly successful pirate, Captain Flint. It is hidden on a distant, mysterious island - and Jim just manages to escape the furious pirates with the map! Now the prospect of finding such fantastic wealth begins to exert a magic spell on all and sundry. Soon Jim is part of an expedition alongside long-legged Long John Silver to find the treasure. At first the journey at sea is a new, unfamiliar adventure for Jim although he is fascinated by the charismatic Long John Silver. Though quickly he discovers that the crew Silver recruited is made up of fierce pirates - rough-and-ready, brutal bandits who have sailed the seven seas in search of booty. The motley crew also includes 17-year-old Sheila, disguised as a ship's boy. The pretty young girl is pursuing the treasure for reasons of her own: as the daughter of Captain Flint, she believes she alone is entitled to it - and she is prepared to go to any lengths to get the loot! But Jim Hawkins knows all too well that her life will be worthless if Long John Silver and his men should they discover her. As the Hispaniola sails onwards towards the Treasure Island, Jim tries to gain Sheila's trust - to help her find the traces of her deceased father's life in the buried treasure. Thus the thrilling adventure begins, and Jim is exposed to a whole range of terrible ordeals - starting with mutiny! When our heroes finally reach the mysterious island they find ample evidence of Captain Flint's gruesome deeds, including a crazed shipmate who was abandoned here years ago and is now intent on violent revenge. As the tale of treachery and pirate treasure unfolds, Jim is forced to grow up quickly - or die! As he undergoes thrilling adventures and survives by the skin of his teeth, his experiences help Jim become a man. But will he find the treasure in the end? Will Sheila obtain her inheritance? And how many of them will leave Treasure Island alive?
