It is the 31st Century and Ulysses is a famous explorer and pilot in space but he desires to go home to Earth to his wife.

En route to Earth Telemachus is kidnapped and is taken to the Cyclops, a huge robot with one eye and is worshiped by a cult. Ulysses destroys the Cyclops and as well as rescuing Telemachus takes Numenor and Yumi, two children from the planet Zotra with them.
